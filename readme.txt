Boost your SEO and SEO optimise your website even further with this Google+ profile widget!

== Description ==

Boost your SEO and SEO optimise your website even further with this Google+ profile widget! Link your Google+ page, profil or community to your site. Get more recommendations for your site in Google search and grow your audience on Google+ with this great WordPress module.

Google's new Google+ service is taking the development world by storm, and why shouldn't it?  It's minimalistic UI, use of cutting edge web techniques, and overall usability make it Google+ one of the more impressive web applications I've seen in quite a while (I was going to say "since Google Wave", but that one didn't end up well, did it?) Google+ allows you to share photos, links, statuses, and much more;  consider it a mesh between Twitter and Facebook.

Google+ will only gain more traction, meaning that the information we share will be pushed to more and more people. This presents an excellent opportunity to promote our websites, much in the way that Twitter and Facebook have.
